Krishna Tank,California State University - East Bay        Part-time,7 mos,Graduate Research Assistant for the Research work on First Person Perspective Video Activity Recognition using Computer Vision which has been published by SPIE digital library in the event SPIE Defense + Commercial Sensing| 2020| Online Only| California| United States.Abstract of the Paper :The initial development of two First-Person Perspective Video Activity Recognition Systems is discussed. The first system| the First Person Fall Detection or UFall| can be used to recognize when a person wearing or holding the mobile vision system has fallen. The problem of fall detection is tackled from the unique first-person perspective. The second system| the directed CrossWalk System (UCross)| involves detection of the user movement across a crosswalk and is intended for use in helping a low vision person navigate. In both cases| the user is wearing or holding the camera device for purposes of monitoring or inspection of the environment. This first-person perspective yields unusual fall data and this is captured and used for the creation of a fall detection system. For both systems Machine Learning is employed using video input to trained Long-Term Short-Term (LSTM) Networks. These first-perspective video activity recognition systems use the Tensorflow framework [1] and is deployed using mobile phones for proof of concept. These applications could be useful for low vision people and in the case of fall detection for senior citizens| police| construction and other inspection-oriented jobs to help users who have fallen. The success and challenges faced with this unique first-person perspective data are presented along with future avenues of work.        …          see more
